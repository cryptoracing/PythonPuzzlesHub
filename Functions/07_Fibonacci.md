**Fibonacci Sequence Generator**

Write a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

The function should accept an integer `n` as input, representing the number of terms to generate in the Fibonacci sequence, and return a list containing the Fibonacci sequence up to the `n`th term.

**Example:**

Input:
- Number of Terms: **10**

Output:
- Fibonacci Sequence: **[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]**
