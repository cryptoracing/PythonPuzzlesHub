**Room Area Calculation**

Write a program that prompts the user for the **length** and **width** of a room. After entering the values, calculate the area of the room and display the **result** on the screen.

The **length** and **width** of the room should be entered in floating-point format. Enhance the input and output with units of measurement - **meters**.

**Example:**
