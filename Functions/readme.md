# Functions Exercises

Welcome to a series of programming exercises designed to practice functions! Each exercise requires you to write functions to solve specific tasks. Here are the rules for completing these projects:

1. **Function Creation**: For each exercise, you need to write at least two functions to solve the given task. You can choose different approaches or algorithms for each function.

2. **Multiple Solutions**: Each function should have a different solutions. This encourages you to explore various techniques, such as iterative vs. recursive solutions, or different algorithmic approaches.

3. **Documentation**: Document each function clearly with comments or docstrings to explain its purpose, parameters, and return value.

4. **Testing**: Test your functions with different inputs to ensure they work correctly for various scenarios.

5. **Code Quality**: Write clean, readable, and well-structured code. Follow best practices for naming variables and functions, and use appropriate coding style.

6. **Submission**: Fork the project repository, create a new branch for your solutions, commit your changes, and push them to the repository. Then create a pull request to submit your solutions.
